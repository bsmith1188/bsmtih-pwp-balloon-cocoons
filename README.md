Personal website project based on a side business my mom runs.

## Milestone 1 feedback

Purpose was very well thoughtout but a little out of scope for this project. Something like wordpress with a CMS would much better serve the purpose that you laid out for this project. That being said this project is doable if you refine the scope A little bit more. The main thing is keeping the site static and not having any type of backend. IF you want you can have more than a one page site but you cannnot go over four pages. 

Both audiance,and goals are well thought out and very obtainable for this porject.

The persona is well thoughtout but fetish is not a good word to use in a business/class setting. ps what is an apple fetish?

The usecase is also well written but might need to be rethougtout with a refocusing of the purpose.

## edits

Like I said before work on making sure everything fits in the expectations of the project.
