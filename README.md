# bsmtih-pwp-balloon-cocoons
Personal website project based on a side business my mom runs.

## Milestone 1 feedback

Purpose was very well thoughtout but a little out of scope for this project. Something like wordpress with a CMS would much better serve the purpose that you laid out for this project. That being said this project is doable if you refine the scope A little bit more. The main thing is keeping the site static and not having any type of backend. IF you want you can have more than a one page site but you cannnot go over four pages. 

Both audiance,and goals are well thought out and very obtainable for this porject.

The persona is well thoughtout but fetish is not a good word to use in a business/class setting. ps what is an apple fetish?

The usecase is also well written but might need to be rethougtout with a refocusing of the purpose.

## edits

Like I said before work on making sure everything fits in the expectations of the project.

## Milestone 2&alpha; feedback
There is just enough detail here in your wireframes to serve as a basic guide for your HTML/front-end development, but there is definite room for more detail here in regards to your specific UI elements.

The regions where you plan to feature the balloon information will probably be the most complex of your UI. Have a look at the [Bootstrap Thumbnails](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#thumbnails) - this might be a good place to start. 

If you want to feature gallery-like functionality on the image thumbnails, have a look at the  [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/) or [Flickity](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/) plugins. These are both mobile-friendly and easy to implement.

Don't forget to include an actual contact form in your project. If you plan on featuring this form in the footer - you may consider altering your layout a bit for visual balance.

We'll cover how to use the Bootstrap framework to create your layout on Monday. In the meantime, you can use the time to collect your site images and content.

Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are clear to begin development on your PWP, but I strongly encourage refining the wireframes to include a finer level of detail. This way you have a better guide as you begin your development. 

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- In your `.gitignore` line 4 should be `/node_modules` with an underbar, and line 1 should be `.DS_Store`
- The meta charset tag is missing the closing `>` This can be potentially toxic.
- Don't forget the `alt` attribute on your `<img>` tags!

## Final Feedback 

I love what you have accomplished with Balloons Cacoons. The color scheme is really pleasing to the eye. I love how mobile responsive the site is, and you really embodied mobile first development The way you aligned the photos of your project was also nicely done. 

There really is only two problems with your site. One, you have no ReCaptcha for your contact form. Second, because you do not have a ReCaptcha your contact form doesn't work. If you add the ReCaptcha everything should work. If you need any help debugging let me know.
