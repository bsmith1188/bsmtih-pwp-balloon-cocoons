		<h1>Content Documentation</h1>
		<h3>Images of the stock balloons.</h3>
		<p>My mother already has a fair amount of documentation of her baloons especailly the popular ones so it would be ideal to have the "premade" balloons listed down the page with a price. The image will be accompanied by a brief description of the content.</p>
		<h3>"Contact Me" section</h3>
		<p>A small footer that "if possible" will always be visible with her contact information so that prospective customers can get her info easily. In the same footer in a different section is just a small text snippet that says custom balloons are available to let people know that their options are not limited at all.</p>
